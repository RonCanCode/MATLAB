# CME100 - Mutivariable Calculus

From Stanford's Explore Courses:

"Computation and visualization using MATLAB. Differential  
vector calculus: analytic geometry in space, functions of  
several variables, partial derivatives, gradient,  
unconstrained maxima and minima, Lagrange multipliers.  
Introduction to linear algebra: matrix operations, systems  
of algebraic equations, methods of solution and  
applications. Integral vector calculus: multiple integrals  
in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, line  
integrals, scalar potential, surface integrals, Green's,  
divergence, and Stokes' theorems. Examples and  
applications drawn from various engineering fields."
